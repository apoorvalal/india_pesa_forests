Mineral atlas: This is deposit latitude and longitude from the Geological Survey of India Mineral Atlas, which we entered from the book index.
deposit_sizes.csv -- definitions of the 3 deposit sizes use in the mineral atlas
mine_prod_district.dta: district-level mineral production, employment, and value from the Statistics of Mineral Information for a bunch of years. A lot of years are missing because we couldn't find those volumes. There's a ton of additional information in SMI (like kilotons of explosives used in each district-year), which we have somewhere but not directly at hand.
